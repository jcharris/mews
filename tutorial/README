FIRST STEPS

To see how this works on a simple example, first, run
tutorial_setup.py, which will generate a synthetic wave field at two
positions, stored first in a pandas dataframe then saved to a text
file, 'data/tutorial_data.csv'.

Next, run tutorial_pred.py, which will read in the data and construct
a prediction and plot it.

WHAT'S NEXT

For getting started with more complex cases, wave propagation over a
submerged bar would be a good next example:

- download the experimental data from
  <http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.1408.3443>

- run src/bar_fwd.py to reproduce prediction of the JLN and JLP test cases

- for passing to other combinations of wave gauges, look at
  src/get_HL2.py for proposed values of H (horizon) and L (look-back)
  to use
